<h1>SilverKing Versioning</h1>

<p>
In addition to its key, each value stored in SilverKing has a version and a creation time associated with it. Versions may be supplied by users, or generated by SilverKing. Creation times are always generated by SilverKing at the time of value creation.
</p>

<p>
Each namespace in SilverKing specifies how the version and creation time are used in <a href="javadocs/com/ms/silverking/cloud/dht/NamespaceOptions.html">NamespaceOptions</a>. For instance, some namespaces may specify that only a single value is ever associated with a key. Other namespaces may allow multiple values to be associated with a single key. In particular, each namespace specifies a <a href="javadocs/com/ms/silverking/cloud/dht/NamespaceVersionMode.html">NamespaceVersionMode</a> and a <a href="javadocs/com/ms/silverking/cloud/dht/RevisionMode.html">RevisionMode</a>. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="javadocs/com/ms/silverking/cloud/dht/NamespaceVersionMode.html">NamespaceVersionMode</a> specifies how versions for keys are supplied as follows:
<ul>
  <li>SINGLE_VERSION - Only a single version may be associated with the value. The version number is undefined and should not be used externally in this case.</li>
  <li>CLIENT_SPECIFIED - Multiple versions of a value may exist. The client must explicitly specify the version.</li>
  <li>SEQUENTIAL - Versions will be generated automatically from the positive integers.</li>
  <li>SYSTEM_TIME_MILLIS - Versions will be generated automatically using the system time in milliseconds.</li>
  <li>SYSTEM_TIME_NANOS - Versions will be generated automatically using the system time in nanoseconds.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
A revision is the creation of a value with a version <= the latest stored version (creation time is always monotonically increasing.) <a href="javadocs/com/ms/silverking/cloud/dht/RevisionMode.html">RevisionMode</a> controls whether or not a given namespace allows revisions using the value of either NO_REVISIONS or UNRESTRICTED_REVISIONS.
</p>

<p>
A SINGLE_VERSION namespace is also "write once" iff its revision mode is NO_REVISIONS; otherwise, while there is only a single version associated with any one key, different values may be associated with a key at different creation times.
</p>

<p>
Retrieval operations may specify which of the potentially several values associated with a given key are retrieved using a VersionConstraint. A VersionConstraint is specified with the following attributes:
<ul>
  <li>min - The minimum acceptable version inclusive.</li>
  <li>max - The maximum acceptable version inclusive.</li>
  <li>mode - When multiple versions match, selects either the LEAST or GREATEST of these versions.</li>
  <li>maxCreationTime - The maximum creation time allowed (inclusive.) (A minimum creation time is not specified since value with the maximum matching creation time is always retrieved.)</li>
</ul>
